## Introduction
Welcome to my Instagram Portfolio, where I present the knowledge I've gained from the Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course taught at KLE Technological University. During this course, I explored the various algorithms and data structures, focusing on their practical applications in real-world situations. This portfolio showcases these learnings through various business cases, each highlighting a different aspect of algorithmic problem-solving and its importance in enhancing social media management.

## Objectives
* Showcase the algorithms and data structures learned during the APS.
* Illustrate how algorithmic problem solving techniques can be applied to optimize and enhance various aspects of social media management.
* Provide a clear understanding of how advanced algorithms and data structures can solve complex problems and improve efficiency in social media platforms.
* Serve as an educational resource for others interested in understanding the application of algorithms and data structures in social media platforms.
