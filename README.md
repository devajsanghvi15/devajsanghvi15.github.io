## Introduction
Welcome to my Instagram Portfolio, where I present the knowledge I've gained from the Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course taught at KLE Technological University. During this course, I explored the various algorithms and data structures, focusing on their practical applications in real-world situations. This portfolio showcases these learnings through various business cases, each highlighting a different aspect of algorithmic problem-solving and its importance in enhancing social media management.

## Why Instagram?
![Instagram-algorithm](https://github.com/devajsanghvi15/devajsanghvi15.github.io/assets/136953523/95ecb0d4-9c47-42e2-8783-44a0a1f029d7)

Instagram is a widely popular social media platform originally launched in 2010, primarily focused on sharing photos and videos. Over the years, Instagram has expanded its features to include stories, IGTV, Reels and many more. With over 2 billion monthly active users [[1]](https://www.statista.com/topics/1882/instagram/){:target="_blank"}, 46,740 photos are posted per minute by users [[2]](https://bernardmarr.com/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/){:target="_blank"}. Instagram generated an estimated $60.3 billion revenue in 2023, accounting for almost 44% of Facebook‚Äôs total revenue [[3]](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/){:target="_blank"}. Instagram users watch 17.6 million hours of reels per day [[4]](https://influencermarketinghub.com/instagram-reels-stats/){:target="_blank"}. Leading countries by Instagram users are India, USA, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey [[5]](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/instagram-users-by-country){:target="_blank"}.

To handle such amount of large data, Instagram must be using advanced data structures and algorithms under the hood. By examining existing and potential use cases for these technologies, this portfolio aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of their impact on the platform.


## Objectives
* Showcase the algorithms and data structures learned during APS.
* Illustrate how algorithmic problem solving techniques can be applied to optimize and enhance various aspects of social media management.
* Provide a clear understanding of how advanced algorithms and data structures can solve complex problems and improve efficiency in social media platforms.
* Serve as an educational resource for others interested in understanding the application of algorithms and data structures in social media platforms.

## Business Cases

**1. #Ô∏è‚É£ Autocomplete Hashtag Searches**

**Use Case**  
* Users might not want to type the entire hashtag when they search for posts related to it (especially when the hashtag is big). Tries can be used for autocomplete functionality in hashtag searches. They efficiently store and retrieve strings based on prefixes, allowing Instagram to suggest completions as users type.

![one](https://github.com/devajsanghvi15/devajsanghvi15.github.io/assets/136953523/bd8580bc-ee22-4fc9-921b-1a02d64a5c87)

**Challenges**  
* Using tries with very long strings can be impractical.

**Market Benefits**  
* Allows users to find all hashtags that start with a given prefix efficiently.

**DSA Used, Design Technique and Performance Analysis**
* Tries: Tree data structure, Prefix tree
  * Time Complexity: O(L) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, where L is the length of the key (typically a word).
  * Space Complexity: O(ALPHABET_SIZE * L) where ALPHABET_SIZE is the number of possible characters and L is the length of the key.
