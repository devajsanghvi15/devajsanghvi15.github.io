## Introduction
Welcome to my Instagram Portfolio, where I present the knowledge I've gained from the Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course taught at KLE Technological University. During this course, I explored the various algorithms and data structures, focusing on their practical applications in real-world situations. This portfolio showcases these learnings through various business cases, each highlighting a different aspect of algorithmic problem-solving and its importance in enhancing social media management.

## Objectives
* Showcase the algorithms and data structures learned during APS.
* Illustrate how algorithmic problem solving techniques can be applied to optimize and enhance various aspects of social media management.
* Provide a clear understanding of how advanced algorithms and data structures can solve complex problems and improve efficiency in social media platforms.
* Serve as an educational resource for others interested in understanding the application of algorithms and data structures in social media platforms.

## Business Cases

**1. Autocomplete Hashtag Searches**

**Use Case**  
Users might not want to type the entire hashtag when they search for posts related to it (especially when the hashtag is big). Tries can be used for autocomplete functionality in hashtag searches. They efficiently store and retrieve strings based on prefixes, allowing Instagram to suggest completions as users type.

**Challenges**  
* Using tries with very long strings can be impractical.

**Market Benefits**  
* Allows users to find all hashtags that start with a given prefix efficiently.
